# ChangeFileName

## Why do I make this Program?

There were files such as a1, a2 ,a3 ..., a502. And I found files have real name such as apple or banana. So I had to change a1 to apple, a2 to banana. The workings looks so silly and I decide to change their name with program. I used Python because I used before. I didn't study python that much but it was easy to use.
